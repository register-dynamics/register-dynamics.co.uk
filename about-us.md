  - template: content
    content: We created Register Dynamics in 2016, with the dream to build a business
      we could all be proud of. We wanted to create a business where technology could
      blossom, where we could enjoy the work that we do and where we would also have
      time for everything else that matters in life too!

    text: Our shared vision
  - template: content
    content: When we formed the business, we knew that we wanted to create a company
      based on our shared values of openness, honesty and integrity. A place where
      people come first, where everyone’s voice is equal and where technology can
      be harnessed as a tool to support everything that we do.

      We (Andy and Simon), also shared a deep passion for data, technology and making things better. We were both well established in our careers as technologists, data specialists and as business people but we both felt as though we had much more to give.

      We decided to step up and to build a business where we could make a more direct, positive impact in the market and to improve how people can use technology more efficiently and access their data more effectively.

      Since our company began, we have learned a lot, we have grown and we have had the honour of working with some amazing and diverse organisations (see our [Case Studies](https://www.register-dynamics.co.uk/case-studies/)).

      We believe in developing long lasting relationships with each of our clients and strive to be their trusted partners.

      Each of us in our team has different passions and motivations that drive us and that have brought us to where we are today. As a company we appreciate our similarities and celebrate our differences. Every day we continue to build this dream together.

    title: People matter
    body: |
      In everything that we approach and do, for us, people always come first.

      At Register Dynamics we pride ourselves on only doing work that we love, and on making sure that everyone has the time and space to explore all of their interests - both inside and outside of work.

      With our clients we form deep, long-term relationships and focus on what matters most to them. We focus on the user needs and work hard to ensure that their voice is heard and taken seriously.

      Whether you are working within Register Dynamics, or with us as a client, we will be working with you side-by-side.

      We believe that by going through our journeys together and by working collaboratively as partners (rather than working for you or you working for us), we will create a much stronger team and end result.

      We are a diverse team of technologists, data strategists, data architects, executive leaders and business developers.

      What sets us apart is our ability to combine our deep knowledge in technology with our strong business acumen. This is made possible from our wealth of experience working at and with senior executives at the highest levels in a variety of organisations.
