excerpt: |
  The Department for International Trade (DIT) released the new future UK tariff
  as an openly licensed and machine-readable data set for the first time. Simon
  Worthington explains how the data team collaborated with policy colleagues all
  across government, all while dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on
  personal and professional lives.

  _This is a guest post on the Department for International Trade "Digital Trade" blog._
