excerpt: |
  Simon discusses his project Personal Data Exchange: a data sharing federation that makes personal data sharing for government services easier, more private and more secure. It aims to make what one department knows available to another department’s service, sharing only what needs to be known for eligibility and making sure citizen data isn’t used for any other purpose. It provides audited, compliant, privacy-preserving and useful data access everywhere, both online and for staff.
