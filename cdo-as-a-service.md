      CDO as a service is a cost effective and flexible alternative to recruiting a permanent Chief Data Officer.

      A Chief Data Officer (not to be mistaken for the Chief Digital Officer) is a senior executive responsible for the organisation-wide utilisation and governance of data. The role focuses on deriving the most value out of data for the organisation. This often includes being responsible for data strategy, data management, policy, privacy and compliance.

      Through our CDO as a service, you will get a highly talented Chief Data Officer with a wealth of industry experience, insight and knowledge, joining your team on your terms. Access top talent and senior leadership on-demand and with minimal risks and costs.
