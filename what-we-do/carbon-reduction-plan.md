## Commitment to achieving Net Zero

Register Dynamics is committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050.

## Baseline Emissions Footprint

Baseline emissions are a record of the greenhouse gases that have been produced in the past and were produced prior to the introduction of any strategies to reduce emissions. Baseline emissions are the reference point against which emissions reduction can be measured.

Baseline Year: 2021

### Additional Details relating to the Baseline Emissions calculations
This calculation was completed using the [GHG Emissions Calculation Tool](https://ghgprotocol.org/ghg-emissions-calculation-tool).

We have made the calculation that throughout 2021 and mainly due to the effects of the global pandemic, our employees have worked from a client office on average 1 day out of every 10 working days. The majority of our carbon footprint therefore comes from home office electricity usage, with a minor contribution from commuting travel.

### Baseline year emissions

| EMISSIONS       | TOTAL (tCO2e) |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| Scope 1         | 0.00          |
| Scope 2         | 1.64          |
| Scope 3         | 0.08          |
| Total Emissions | 1.72          |

## Emissions reduction targets
In order to continue our progress to achieving Net Zero, we have adopted the following carbon reduction targets:

* We will aim for a complete reduction of net carbon emissions by 2030.

## Carbon reduction projects
The following environmental management measures and projects have been implemented since the 2021 baseline:

* Encouraging employees working from home to adopt carbon neutral energy from renewable sources.
* Encouraging employees to commute using mass transit or, where possible, net zero transport.
* Where possible with our customers, aiming for complete remote working to avoid business travel.

## Declaration and sign off
This Carbon Reduction Plan has been completed in accordance with PPN 06/21 and associated guidance and reporting standard for Carbon Reduction Plans.

Emissions have been reported and recorded in accordance with the published reporting standard for Carbon Reduction Plans and the [GHG Reporting Protocol corporate standard](https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-standard) and uses the appropriate Government [emission conversion factors for greenhouse gas company reporting](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-conversion-factors-for-company-reporting).

Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been reported in accordance with SECR requirements, and the required subset of Scope 3 emissions have been reported in accordance with the [published reporting standard for Carbon Reduction Plans and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard](https://ghgprotocol.org/standards/scope-3-standard).

This Carbon Reduction Plan has been reviewed and signed off by the board of directors (or equivalent management body).
