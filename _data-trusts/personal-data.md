We have a problem with personal data. As we carry out more of our lives in the digital realm, the data generated and held about us grows. With machine learning and artificial intelligence being the buzzwords du jour, the demand for personal data to train and fuel the algorithms is higher than ever, and organisations are increasingly looking at how they can cooperate to make the most of the personal data they hold.

We've seen that when sharing is done badly there is potential for shocking abuse, and consumer business is being won and lost on how data and privacy are protected. Risk of mistakes and reward for innovation are both high, and personal data sharing has never been more difficult. The bar to well-managed and appropriate personal data sharing needs to be lowered in order to unlock all of the innovation benefits.

As an emerging field of interest, people are considering whether data trusts can unlock benefits whilst still retaining privacy and consumer reputation. In a data trust, rights and governance of data are managed by an independent trustee who has legal power to ensure that all the parties involved are sticking to the trust's charter. The charter specifies what data is involved, who can access it and for what purpose.

Data trusts are a good fit for some models of personal data sharing. In this post, we examine some of the motivations behind holding personal data in trust and explain why strong audit trails are key to lower-risk data sharing. To demonstrate, we'll explore a UK Government project that modelled cross-Government personal data sharing to improve service delivery to citizens using a data trust, and show how using cutting-edge technology was able to apply pre- and strong post-audit to support due diligence checks that no data was lost or abused.

## Why use a data trust

We don't have to look far to see examples of personal data sharing going badly wrong. "Cambridge Analytica" has become a household name associated with misuse of personal information and breach of public trust. Notably, the UK Government got into hot water over its sharing of health data for immigration purposes.

It's now widely accepted on both a social and legislative level that organisations must act responsibly when sharing personal data. How to achieve this in each individual case is still a subtle and difficult problem that requires both good legislative understanding and high data literacy – not skills that are prevalent. Factoring in that an organisation's commercial goals for the data share may often directly conflict with their responsibility to maintain privacy, it is easy to see why disproportionate or irresponsible data shares often occur.

In response, GDPR has imposed a high financial penalty for data misuse and the UK Information Commissioner's Office have shown their willingness to discipline non-compliant organisations. This has successfully transformed data proportionality into more than just a moral issue. However, legitimate data sharing is good for innovation and still needs to occur, and the penalties have made many organisations risk-averse.

Civic institutions in particular have a responsibility to ensure that the sensitive personal data they collect to carry out their public services is not misused when shared with either other public sector bodies or private sector partners. They must also be visible and transparent in how they do it. Data trusts are a model that allow them to do so.

With a data trust, an independent trustee is appointed to oversee the terms of the data share. They are responsible for deciding what ends up in the trust's charter which sets out rules for how the personal data can be used. They would also have responsibility for ensuring that those terms had been followed.

Trustees should be subject matter experts on personal data and have the necessary skills and experience to judge what is appropriate. Of course, they don't exist in a vacuum of political will and the organisation's goals for the sharing still need to be met. Their role is to support the data sharers in understanding their obligations and influence the end result. As they are independent, they can announce publicly that they agree (or not) that the terms are appropriate.

## Why have audit technology

Once a data trust for personal data sharing has been set-up and the beneficiaries have started sharing personal data, the trustee's job is not over. It used to be commonly accepted amongst security professionals that as long as a contract exists, the risk of data being misused was low. But just having a bit of paper where participants have signed on the dotted line isn't enough to ensure the rights of data subjects are protected.

### Case Study: Facebook

In the aforementioned Cambridge Analytica scandal the contract terms were completely ignored and personal data was misused. Facebook's defence was that the parties involved had acted outside of the terms of the data share and they were therefore not at fault. The lack of any hard, technical evidence deprived courts of useful information.

This doesn't give much confidence to individuals – without any actual audit and enforcement of their terms, it's difficult to see how Facebook will prevent this behaviour from occurring again. What is required is a means to actually check how the data has been used and whether this matches the agreed terms. Data subjects need sharing to be audited to have any confidence at all that their data is safe.

Facebook's reputation suffered greatly from the negative publicity despite their claims of innocence. Cambridge Analytica failed completely. Clearly, organisations looking to do similar data sharing are concerned about their own reputational and corporate risks. Their response to this has been to increase their assurance processes which are time-consuming and expensive. If they were able to audit and know categorically that their sharing partners and their own employees were not acting improperly – and to evidence publicly (either by making public some information or by receiving the vouching from an auditor) that this was the case – the associated risk could be dramatically lower and they could save time and energy.

## Why audit

In addition to all of this, it's important for trustees to be able to build their own reputation and show that they are effectively fulfilling their purpose. Risk that the data providers or processors in the trust can misbehave in an invisible manner directly translates to reputational risk for the trustee. Being able to audit the activity on the data in trust is the most effective way to reduce this risk to their reputation. Good trustees will demand the ability to audit.

Audit brings benefits to everyone – beneficiaries, trustees and the general public – but no-one will choose to do something that isn't pragmatic. On the surface, it's difficult to imagine how an audit process could work that wouldn't require as much effort put in as the original data use itself. These benefits can only be unlocked if actually doing auditing represents a good return on the time and effort involved.

Enabling audit to be cost-effective is exactly the end goal of audit technology. The vision is to allow trustees or specialist auditors to have a complete view of the who, what and why of data use – something that would otherwise be too burdensome to be realistic. The field is still developing. Lots of progress has been made by custom-designed solutions for specific problems and in identifying patterns that can be reused. We are however not yet near a general solution or mature set of methods.

By examining case studies in audit technology, our purpose is to show that cost-effective strong auditing is possible today and encourage others to build things that reduces the cost further in the future. With better audit unlocked for more use cases, data trusts can fulfil their potential as a powerful model that allows organisations to make better use of their personal data whilst still ensuring privacy and proportionality for the subjects involved.
