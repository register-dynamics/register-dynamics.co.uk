title: ONS Safe Settings
excerpt: |
  When a data trust contains arbitrary data undergoing some kind of arbitrary analysis, how do you take the analysis to the data in a non-burdensome way? The answer is to audit the data as it egresses the trust. We look specifically at "Safe Settings", alternatives to downloading and processing locally, and whether these can be achieved virtually.
