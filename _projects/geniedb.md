During the "NoSQL revolution", clients consistently found that their existing databases were unable to scale to keep up with demand. Their only choice was to completely rewrite their applications using new database technology.

GenieDB changed the narrative by bringing the advantages of NoSQL to existing MySQL-based applications. We let organisations scale their MySQL clusters horizontally whilst keeping their existing code unchanged.

We delivered a $1m project to productise a replicated database engine based on R&D outputs. We provided the route to market for this new product by defining, architecting and building the MySQL integration. We pioneered modern DevOps and CI/CD practices through a fully automated VM-based test system.

We formulated open source product and platform strategies that would allow us to compete in the fledging NoSQL space and coached executives on how open source could be used to an advantage in the cloud. We negotiated with executives in the finance, supply chain and online media sectors to drive adoption and to ensure our roadmap would meet customer needs.
