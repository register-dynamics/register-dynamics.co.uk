We established the [Personal Data Exchange programme](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/25/digital-eligibility-checks-for-service-teams/) to make online services better for citizens through cross-government data sharing, as part of the Government Transformation Strategy. We identified Â£100m of savings across six local government services and scope for use by over 300 central government services.

Next we set out a product growth strategy to give value from first adoption through to use by a wide ecosystem of data providers and consumers. This gave an immediate boost to new services and allowed gradual transformation of legacy services struggling to digitise.

The cutting-edge model we created describes how personal data could work in government. From this we developed an [architecture and open standard](https://github.com/alphagov/aquae-specification) to query personal data in a private, secure, and ethical way that works within the existing structure of government.

By deliberately segmenting the architecture into technical, legal and policy components, we enabled agile development and flexible adoption. Explore our [proof of concept](https://github.com/alphagov/blue-badge-demo) for an existing local authority service.
