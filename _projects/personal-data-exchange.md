We established the [Personal Data Exchange programme](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/25/digital-eligibility-checks-for-service-teams/) to transform online services for citizens as part of the Government Transformation Strategy. In our discovery we identified Â£100m of savings across six local government services and scope for use by more than 300 central government services.

We set out a product growth strategy to deliver value from the first adoption through to a wide ecosystem of data providers and consumers. This delivered immediate value to new services whilst allowing gradual transformation of entrenched, legacy services that were struggling to digitise.

We created a cutting-edge model that describes how personal data works in government. We developed this into an [architecture and open standard](https://github.com/alphagov/aquae-specification) to query personal data in a private, secure, and ethical way that works within the existing structure of government. By deliberately segmenting the architecture into a set of technical, legal and policy components, we enabled both agile development by us and flexible adoption by others. We delivered a [proof of concept](https://github.com/alphagov/blue-badge-demo) for an existing local authority service.
