We helped move the [GOV.UK Open Registers](https://registers.service.gov.uk/) service from proof-of-concept into production. We grew the ecosystem from a single register to many more across a range of government departments. We designed and introduced a strategic technical roadmap to drive adoption and solve real user problems.

Our roadmap included architectural blueprints describing how to [combine registers with other data sources](https://github.com/openregister/kibitz). We applied this in the [GOV.UK Location Picker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-country-and-territory-autocomplete) to allow users to select a country by a name, synonym or endonym â€“ a much-needed feature that was [well received by the service community](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/20/were-building-an-autocomplete/).

Our expertise in database systems and blockchain techniques enabled us to develop features for cryptographic proofs and functional indexes in the underlying Open Register technology.
