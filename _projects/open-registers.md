We helped move the [GOV.UK Open Registers](https://registers.service.gov.uk/) service from the proof-of-concept stage into the first production phase. We grew the ecosystem from a single register to an order of magnitude more across a range of other government departments. We put in place a strategically-designed technical roadmap focused on features to drive adoption and solve real user problems.

As part of the roadmap, we developed architectural blueprints that described how to [combine registers with other data sources](https://github.com/openregister/kibitz). We applied this in the [GOV.UK Location Picker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-country-and-territory-autocomplete) to allow users to select a country by a name, synonym or endonym â€“ a feature that was much needed and [well received](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/20/were-building-an-autocomplete/) by the service community.

Our expertise in database systems and blockchaining techniques allowed us to develop features for cryptographic proofs and functional indexes in the underlying Open Register technology.
