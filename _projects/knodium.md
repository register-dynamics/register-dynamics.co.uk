We built a platform for student collaboration  with peers, lecturers and mentors on academic projects. Knodium had users from over a hundred UK and international universities â€“ we provided these organisations engagement data and analysis to help them understand their students.

We allowed universities to measure how well their students were actually engaging with their course material. We also showed them student interactions based on social groups, unconstrained by the traditional hierarchical structure of faculties, departments, courses and year groups.

We used this social graph technology and engagement data to predict drop-out before it happened, allowing universities to identify vulnerable students.
