We built a collaboration platform allowing students to engage with their peers, lecturers and mentors around academic projects. Knodium had users from over one hundred UK and international universities. We provided these organisations with engagement data and understanding of their students.

We allowed universities to measure how well students were really engaging with their course material. We also exposed how their students actually interact based on social groups, unconstrainted by the traditional hierarchical structure of faculties, departments, courses and year groups.

We used social graph technology and engagement data to predict drop-out before it happened and allowed universities to identify vulnerable students.
