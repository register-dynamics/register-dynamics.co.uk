By developing an automated data flow we were able to transform hundreds of biographies of former pupils from a proprietary, unstructured format into a structured dataset. Working with a graphic designer, we built an iPad app for the profiles which easily deployed to an offline kiosk.

Our heuristics extracted useful content from an unstructured format and correlated it with scanned images and tabular data to build a complete profile of a single pupil. We saved our client the hundreds of hours it would take to do this manually.

We reused the data flow to extend the exhibition, adding more biographies plus archive material around medals.

Using digital data engineering techniques we were able to carry this project out at a competitive rate â€“ as no manual processing was requied, we were able to supply very high quality results.
