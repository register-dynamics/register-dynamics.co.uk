We developed an automated data pipeline to transform hundreds of biographies of former pupils from a proprietary, unstructured format into a structured dataset. Working with a graphic designer, we built an iPad app around the profiles to easily deploy onto an offline kiosk.

Our heuristics extracted the useful content from the unstructured format and correlated it with scanned images and tabular data to build a complete profile of a single pupil. We saved King Edward's School the hundreds of hours required to prepare this manually.

We reused the pipeline for further work to extend the exhibition with additional biographies and newly discovered archive material around medals.

Using our techniques, we were able to offer King Edward's School a competitive rate through the lack of manual processing required and made available to them a higher quality outcome than they would have otherwise had access to.
